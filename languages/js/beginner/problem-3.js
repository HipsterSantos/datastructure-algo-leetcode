// Check for a set of prime factors.
// Let’s define ugly numbers as those whose only prime factors are
// 2, 3, or 5. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, … shows the
// first 11 ugly numbers. By convention, 1 is included.
// To do this, divide the number by the divisors (2, 3, 5) until it
// cannot be divided without a remainder. If the number can be
// divided by all the divisors, it should be 1 after dividing everything.
