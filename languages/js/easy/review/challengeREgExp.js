To conclude the chapter, weâ€™ll look at a problem that calls for regular expres-
sions. Imagine we are writing a program to automatically collect information
about our enemies from the Internet. (We will not actually write that program
here, just the part that reads the configuration file. Sorry.) The configuration
file looks like this:

Warning: Content from Eloquent JavaScriptBook p(160)

function parseINI(string){
  //Start with an object to hold the top-level fields
  let result = {};
  let section = resul;
  string.split(/\r?\n/).forEach(line=>{
    let match;
    if(match == line.match(/^(\w+)=(.*)$/)){
      section[match[1]] = match[2];
    }else if(match = line.match(/^\[(.*)\]$/)){
      section = result[match[1]] = {};
    }else if( !/^\s*(;.*)?$/.test(line)){
      throw new Error("Line '"+line+"'is not valid .")
    }
  })

  return result;
}

TI  - Ectopic pregnancy: History, incidence, epidemiology, and risk factors.
PG  - 376-86
LID - 10.1097/GRF.0b013e3182516d7b [doi]
AB  - Ectopic pregnancy is directly related to tubal infection, and so prevention of
      chlamydia and gonorrhea must be the watchword to lower its risk and incidence. With
      accurate determination of very low human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations and
      sonography, >85% of women are diagnosed before tubal rupture, which has led to
      medical therapy and laparoscopic surgery with tubal preservation and the potential
      for future fertility. Today, early intervention saves lives and reduces morbidity,
      but ectopic pregnancy still accounts for 4% to 10% of pregnancy-related deaths and
      leads to a high incidence of ectopic site gestations in subsequent pregnancies.
